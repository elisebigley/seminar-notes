">>>" interpreter 
">" or $ command/terminal 

Save a docu on a text editor as my search.py 

Instead of messing with the interpreter 

Copy your commands into a text editor and then you type in to the command line/terminal python my search.py

Don't use both the tab key and the space bar. Tab and space bar are different and have different codes underneath. If you use both it will mess up your script.
