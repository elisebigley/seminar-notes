Today's seminar made me think of [Voyant](voyant-tools.org) in new ways. When I had previously used Voyant for a [tool tutorial](https://github.com/elisebigley/voyant-tool-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md) and [text analysis assignment](https://github.com/elisebigley/text-analysis-assignment/blob/master/Text%20Analysis.md) I approached Voyant as a way to view how data is layed out in various texts.
If you look to my [tool tutorial](https://github.com/elisebigley/voyant-tool-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md) in the "Cirrus" section, I outline how to eliminate words such as "and, or, there, here, at, in." The issues with eliminating these "stop words" is that it will not recognize all of the words that you would consider irrelevant to the text you are analyzing.
What I have found is that cutting out these "stop words" (which you can do manually, for example: "pp, #9, isbn") is a necessary process. However, I found this process led me down the rabbit hole... This is where I realized that what a "stop word" (beyond the standard "stop words" for the English language) is decided based on the judgment of the user. It is also project specific. Some words like "he, she" may be central to the analysis in one project, while "#9" may potentially be very important to understanding the text in another project. 
It is clear that text analysis is not as black and white as I used to imagine. Our own judgment plays an integral part in determining which words are included in the analysis, and the final text analysis itself! So, beware! Your good judgment is needed in every step of this process.
